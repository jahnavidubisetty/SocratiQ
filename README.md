# SocratiQ: AI-Powered Teaching Assistant for DSA

## Project Description
SocratiQ is an AI-driven teaching assistant designed to help students learn Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) through the Socratic method. By asking probing, context-specific questions, the assistant leads students to discover solutions for themselves, encouraging deeper understanding and problem-solving skills. The focus is narrowed to algorithms, such as sorting, to ensure high-quality, personalized interaction.

## Technologies Used
Python, TensorFlow, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, SQLite, Git, Docker, OpenAI API, Jupyter Notebook, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas.

## Features
- **Socratic Method:** Dynamic, question-driven approach to guide students toward answers.
- **Personalization:** Adapts to the studentâ€™s progress, tailoring questions to their responses and learning pace.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Instant feedback and adaptive questioning based on test-case analysis.

## Challenges
- Effective question generation.
- Understanding user input.
- Balancing complexity.
- Technical performance optimization.

## Future Opportunities
- Expansion to other computer science topics.
- Enhanced learning styles with gamification and visual aids.
- Cross-language support.
- Collaborative learning features.
